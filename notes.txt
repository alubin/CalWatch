If you look at the full Git history of this file, you'll see it grew quite large at some points and
shrank down at others. Mostly it's served as the ongoing to-do list as well as notes for features in
progress.

Port to Android Wear
-- How to set up the emulator: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/49586/how-do-i-connect-an-android-wear-emulator-to-a-real-phone/
   adb -d forward tcp:5601 tcp:5601

-- How to connect to Bluetooth debugging for Moto 360: http://blog.timmattison.com/archives/2014/07/16/common-android-wear-tasks-for-developers/
    adb forward tcp:4444 localabstract:/adb-hub; adb connect localhost:4444

-- How to get a dump from the watch into a file and see it while it's going
    adb -s localhost:4444 logcat -v time | & tee logdumps/whatever.txt


TODO sort out how to compile protobufs automatically via Gradle
-- At least the Square protobuf runtime is automatically fetched and compiled
-- probably not worth the bother: long term plan is to kill protobufs, once we have reliable calendar on the wear side

Verify all the weird connect/disconnect corner cases
    TODO fresh boot of phone, make sure service is up no matter what
    TODO disconnect / reconnect of phone from watch
    TODO fresh boot of watch / reconnect to old phone app
    TODO nothing running on phone / fresh watch wants data
    TODO are we recovering properly if the phone kills the service after a long hiatus?

Daydream?
    http://www.hascode.com/2013/01/using-the-android-daydream-api/
    http://developer.android.com/reference/android/service/dreams/DreamService.html
    -- looks almost exactly the same as implementing an activity, or the watchface API

Refactoring / reengineering
    TODO alarm code is repeated on phone and wear side: do it in /shared
    (this is waiting until we have a final idea of how we're supposed to implement a wear app)

    TODO fix Gradle, presently requiring me to have the git version code in three places to work right
    (I tried putting it just in settings.gradle or the top-level build.gradle and this didn't work)

Right-to-left support
    TODO detect when we're in RTL mode
    TODO swap day/date block from 9 o'clock to 3 o'clock or leave alone?

Add internationalization strings
    Currently have localized strings for Spanish, Dutch, Turkish, German; need more

Deal with multiday events that aren't "all day" events
    TODO idea: resurrect all-day events by rendering them (and long events) as thin rings, perhaps separate from the main time wedges

FINAL ANDROID WATCHFACE API !!!
    DONE! task 0: prior work
        DONE! boot Wear 5 emulator, paired with tablet
        DONE! Does the existing release1c APK break on Wear 5? IT WORKS!
        TODO ambient mode on original APK seems broken (based on hitting "F7"), probably not worth fixing
    TODO task 1: graphics
        DONE! Identify best starting place (*not* CalendarWatchFaceService)
        DONE! 1Hz refresh (no calendar at all)
        DONE! 40Hz refresh main (built into SweepWatchFace ?!!)
        DONE! drawing calendar (with old-school data forwarding)
        DONE! redo ambient mode
            DONE! greyscale ambient
            DONE! one-bit ambient
                DONE! hollow out the hands
                DONE! hollow out the time wedges
                DONE! disable anti-aliasing
            NO! distinct behavior for "mute" mode? Do we care? No!
        DONE! specify where the battery-charging indicator goes
            - http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-faces/issues.html
        TODO reshape around peek card?
            - Notes: the rect we get back is the rect *covered* by the card. Using the "top"
              of the rect, we'll know that from (0,0) - (full-width, rect-top) we're good to draw.

            - Given how large the cards are, we probably don't want to mess with the Moto 360 hack
              but instead just want to draw the face small, completely round, and be done with it.

        TODO general-purpose solution to the flat-bottom Moto360 hack
        http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-faces/issues.html

            - Tried this, gets an error about the superclass not having the proper method. Fail!
              See onApplyWindowInsets() in CalWatchFaceService (currently commented out)

        DONE? companion configuration activity
            DONE? intents
            DONE? XML manifest stuff
            - http://developer.android.com/training/wearables/watch-faces/configuration.html

            - Notes: added the relevant bits to the XML, need to test. Kinda sucky that I have
              to do with the emulator rather than my phone.

            TODO can this eliminate the need for notifications?
            - probably not, since we want to be there at boot time; but worth investigating
            - we can definitely nuke notifications once we're done with task 2

        TODO >1 refresh/minute ambient
            - The standard way of doing the sweeping second hand is to just call invalidate()
              right after the end of onDraw(). If we do nothing, onDraw() gets called once per
              minute. We *could* set up an alarm and go to all the trouble that's in MyViewAnim.
              Is it worth it? Not right away. The power measurement gestapo won't stand for it.

        TODO remove MyViewAnim and WearActivity from wear build (mobile only, for now)
            - Hypothetically we could just keep this around and add more stuff to the manifest
              to allow "old school" and "new school" watchfaces to run, but given that all the
              4.4W2 watches are being forcibly upgraded to 5.0, it's just not worth the engineering
              to make this work.

    TODO task 2: calendar
        TODO Move from calendar multithreading to ASyncTask (as in the provided example)
        - this is probably the place to start, as it's going to be more power efficient and
          yield cleaner code. Also a nice warm-up before diving into the next bits.
        TODO WearableCalendarContract vs. CalendarContract: what's exactly missing here?
        - notably, the "AgendaData" example is doing a bunch of phone-side work, just like CalWatch
        TODO Verify that enough of the calendar exists on watch side to avoid transmission from phone
        TODO Kill off serialization and transmission of calendar data (built into the watch now!)
        TODO Kill off notifications on watch side (since they'll get a perfectly useful default)
    Secondary porting issues
        TODO Kill off Protobufs? All we've got is a couple small integers and booleans left
        TODO update the slides

Longer-term items
    Way, way, way too many colors in ClockFace
    TODO have a handful of colors, named for where they're used, centralize how they're set & reset
        - The low-bit ambient mode graphics are, at best, tolerable. Some cleanup in ClockFace
          would make it easier to modify this in one place.
    TODO custom background images?
