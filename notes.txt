    TODO verify on round face
    Kludgy way to detect if we're on round vs. square:

    DONE?! detect Moto 360 and deal with cropping
    -- only way to detect seems to be using android.os.Build.MODEL, but I don't know the value until I've got a real Moto 360.
    -- cropping code is otherwise ready to go

    TODO verify correct operation when ambient mode on phone disabled


TODO sort out how to compile protobufs automatically via Gradle (vs. known bugs lodged with Google)
-- At least the Square protobuf runtime is automatically fetched and compiled
-- Seems to be compiling correctly, might even work on the first try (ha!)

TODO fancier control panel: Material Layout cards

Verify all the weird connect/disconnect corner cases
    TODO fresh boot of phone, make sure service is up no matter what
    TODO disconnect / reconnect of phone from watch
    TODO fresh boot of watch / reconnect to old phone app
    TODO nothing running on phone / fresh watch wants data
    TODO are we recovering properly if the phone kills the service after a long hiatus?

TODO app signing

BUGS BUGs BUGZ!
  TODO incorrect handling of watch lifecycle (shock, horror)
  -- ignoring changes in the Activity seems to be helping, a bit, but we're not learning
     anything, at all, when the user covers the screen with something else. Not good. Also,
     there's some ugliness when another email or event wants to draw on top.

  -- now that we've integrated the 5-second alarm, we should try killing off the
     render thread as part of the onStop() lifecycle *and* should immediately render
     the screen when the lifecycle moves back into action. Will that work?
